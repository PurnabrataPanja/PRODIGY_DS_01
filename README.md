# Population Distribution Visualization

## Overview:
This project visualizes the distribution of population across different age groups over multiple years using bar charts and line plots. The dataset used for visualization is "population_distribution.csv".

## Google Colab Notebook:
The code for generating the visualizations is available in the Google Colab notebook: [Population_Distribution_Visualization.ipynb](Population_Distribution_Visualization.ipynb).

## Dataset:
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Year**: The year for which the population distribution is recorded.
- **0-14 years**: Percentage of population aged 0-14 years.
- **15-64 years**: Percentage of population aged 15-64 years.
- **65 years +**: Percentage of population aged 65 years and above.

## Dependencies:
The following dependencies are required to execute the code:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Visualizations:
### Bar Chart:
A bar chart is created for each age group, showing the percentage of population over the years.

### Line Plot:
A line plot is created for each age group, illustrating the change in population percentage over the years.

## Usage:
To reproduce the visualizations:
1. Download the dataset "population_distribution.csv".
2. Open the Google Colab notebook "Population_Distribution_Visualization.ipynb".
3. Upload the dataset to your Google Colab environment.
4. Run the code cells in the notebook to generate the visualizations.
