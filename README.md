# Population Distribution Visualization
<br>
This project visualizes the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, specifically the percentage distribution of population by age group, using both bar charts and line plots.

<br>
##Introduction
<br>
During an internship at Prodigy InfoTech, the task was to create visualizations that effectively represent the distribution of a chosen variable in a population dataset. In this project, the percentage distribution of population by age group over multiple years is visualized using Python and Matplotlib.

<br>
##Dataset
<br>
The dataset used for this project is "population_distribution.csv", which contains the following columns:

Year: The year of observation.
0-14 years: Percentage of population aged 0-14 years.
15-64 years: Percentage of population aged 15-64 years.
65 years +: Percentage of population aged 65 years and above.

<br>
##Project Structure
<br>
population_distribution.csv: CSV file containing the population distribution data.
Population_Distribution_Visualization.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data visualization.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.
