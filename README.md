# Population Distribution Visualization

This project aims to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram. It was completed as part of an internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Task Description

## Project Details

- **Dataset:** The dataset used for this task is "population_distribution.csv".
- **Visualization Tool:** Python libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn were utilized to create the bar chart or histogram.
- **Google Colab File:** The Google Colab notebook used for this project is available in the repository for reference.
